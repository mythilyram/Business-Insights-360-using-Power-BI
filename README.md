## Problem Statement:

AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly but they still rely on Excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights on such large data. Also due to the lack of effective analytics, the company faced a major loss in some regions.

## Objective:

- Enable data-driven decision-making across all markets.
- Improve transparency in data.
- Deliver a quantitative benefit of 10% incremental profit margin.

![Project Charter link](https://github.com/mythilyram/Business-Insights-360-using-Power-BI/blob/main/3.%20project-charter.pdf)
- In the project kickoff meeting, we discussed the Report features in detail and clarified the doubts we had about it.
- I learned how a ‘Project Charter’ is Used in Companies.
  - A project charter is a short document describing the entire project.
  - We used a tool called Mural for this and covered a few important dimensions of the project such as
  - -Project goal, Key stakeholders, Hopes and fears, Risks etc.
 
### Success measures: 
- Having a functional dashboard implemented.
- Users are able to use this tool in their business review meetings and in the decision-making process including
   - Customer Negotiation
   - New product launch
   - Marketing promotions
   - Finance budgeting.
- Scale it up across the entire organization across all the markets.

### Timeline: 
- Deliver MVP for UAT by the end of week 4. (Minimum viable Product, Unit acceptance testing)
- Data validations, feedback, and implementation then.
- Deliver the final product in 8 Weeks.

### Data correctness and completeness:
To ensure data correctness and completeness, we have multilevel validations. 
- We validate the benchmark Numbers against the database that we received,
- validate once the data is in Power BI,
- validate it again in UAT, and finally
- validate with stakeholders from each department.
